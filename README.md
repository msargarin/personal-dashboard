This project is a personal dashboard app with weather, news and a task management features. This project is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a .env.local file from the .env.sample and input your API keys.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
